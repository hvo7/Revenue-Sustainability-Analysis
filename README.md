# Revenue-Sustainability-Analysis

Glacier is a SaaS company who specializes in releasing product features and platform updates that helps users be able to improve workflows and enhance productivity. The company has been seeking customer adoption and growth following its release of one of its platform updates, which introduced several key new features. Following the release of new updates, revenue growth and success is typically measured by short-term lifts in revenue and engagement; however, not all revenue is equally sustainable. While some growth is a result of promotion, marketing, and one-time purchases, other growth signals can reflect deep customer dependency and repeat customer behavior. 

This blind spot, where some teams may exhaust tremendous effort only to develop releases that seem successful on paper but fail to strengthen long-term retention and sustainable growth, has developed ongoing concern among executives. 

An analysis was thus conducted to:
* Improve release evaluation to understand if product releases build durable customer commitment or merely temporary spikes
* Understand which key metrics are important for tracking short-term vs. long-term growth
* Uncover which factors of the platform fail to develop long-term engagement
